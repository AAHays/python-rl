TODO for pyRL project
====================

Implement Environments (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------

Acrobot
Cart Pole with different styles: RLGlue (easier), Realistic (much harder), swingup vs balance
Mountain Car
Pinball
Tetris
Dart Throwing (from Bruno Castro da Silva's paper on parameterized skills)
Partially Observable Taxi
Simulated-Simplified Red Room (GDK/S.K.'s work, similar to a more functional continuous playroom)
N-DOF Reaching and Reaching through viapoint
Ball in Cup simulation


Implement Agents (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------

Implement "save_trajectory filename numsteps" message support into base class of existing agents

Any simple POMDP solver (needed to fully test generic_pomdp domain code)
LSPI
Rmax
SLF-Rmax
Delayed Q-Learning
TEXPLORE
NAC
TDC
GTD
