TODO for pyRL project
====================

Implement Environments (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------

Cart Pole with different styles: RLGlue (easier), Realistic (much harder), swingup vs balance
Tetris
Dart Throwing (from Bruno Castro da Silva's paper on parameterized skills)
Partially Observable Taxi
Simulated-Simplified Red Room (GDK/S.K.'s work, similar to a more functional continuous playroom)
N-DOF Reaching and Reaching through viapoint
Ball in Cup simulation


Implement Agents (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------

Implement "save_trajectory filename numsteps" message support into base class of existing agents

LSPI/LSTD/RLS-TD
Delayed Q-Learning
NAC
TDC
GTD
Skill Chaining
PoWER
PI^2
TD-delta Pi

Extensions to Existing Implementations:
------------------------------

Add other exploration bonus methods to the modelbased agents
Beginning a new study on adaptive step-sizes
