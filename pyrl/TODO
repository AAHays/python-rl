TODO for pyRL project
====================

Implement Environments (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------
PuddleWorld
Tetris
Dart Throwing (from Bruno Castro da Silva's paper on parameterized skills)
Partially Observable Taxi
Simulated-Simplified Red Room (GDK/S.K.'s work, similar to a more functional continuous playroom)
N-DOF Reaching and Reaching through viapoint
Ball in Cup simulation


Implement Agents (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------

Implement "save_trajectory filename numsteps" message support into base class of existing agents

Delayed Q-Learning
TD-delta Pi
Mirror Descent for RL
NAC / AC / Policy Gradient
TDC / GTD
Skill Chaining
PoWER
PI^2


Extensions to Existing Implementations:
------------------------------

Add other exploration bonus methods to the modelbased agents
Add error bars to the compareParameters visualizer
