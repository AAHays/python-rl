TODO for pyRL project
====================

Implement Environments (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------
Dart Throwing (from Bruno Castro da Silva's paper on parameterized skills)
Partially Observable Taxi
Simulated-Simplified Red Room (GDK/S.K.'s work, similar to a more functional continuous playroom)
N-DOF Reaching and Reaching through viapoint
Ball in Cup simulation


Implement Agents (in Python) or Convert C/C++ into Module:
------------------------------

Implement "save_trajectory filename numsteps" message support into base class of existing agents

TD-delta Pi
TDC / GTD
Skill Chaining
PoWER
PI^2


Extensions to Existing Implementations:
------------------------------

Add other exploration bonus methods to the modelbased agents
Add pygame based viewer for Tetris environment
Provide reasonable 'working' parameters for every agent algorithm. Currently missing:
	Sarsa ANN
	REINFORCE
	Delayed Q-Learning
	Composite Mirror Descent
